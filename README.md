## MultiVersion Recontinued

This is a recontinued version of the MultiVersion plugin by AkmalFairuz

Dont install this on your server, the chances of it crashing are very high, i will update every Sunday

## Supported Protocols

- 1.20.0 (589)
- 1.20.10 (594)
- 1.20.30 (618)

Please note that Microsoft/Mojang made changes in Minecraft Multiplayer which caused everyone to be unable to connect to servers with pre-1.20 client so I do not have any plans to support versions below 1.20 for now
